# Data-Cleaning in SQL
In this project, I extracted a Nashville-Housing dataset in which I found inconsistencies in duplicate records, formatting errors, redundant data, empty fields, and more. In the cleansing process I made the necessary adjustments to reduce these inconsistencies using Microsoft SQL Server in order to boosts the efficiency, utility, and overall readability of the dataset.
