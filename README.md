# Data-Cleaning in SQL
In this project, I extracted a Nashville-Housing dataset in which I found inconsistencies in duplicate records, formatting errors, redundant data, empty fields, and more. In the cleansing process I made the necessary adjustments to reduce these inconsistencies using Microsoft SQL Server in order to boosts the efficiency, utility, and overall readability of the dataset.
# Demonstrated Skills: 
* Converting Datatypes 
* Populate columns containing NULL values 
* Joins 
* String Functions (SUBSTRING & PARSENAME)
* ALTER/UPDATE TABLE Statements 
* Case Statements 
* Window Functions (ROW
* Common Table Expressions (CTE - WITH Clause)
# Objectives:
* Covert the Date column to have a Standardized Date format
* Populate columns containing NULL values 
* Use SUBSTRING and PARSENAME to break apart columns with full addresses 
* Standardize and replace fields with Y/N to Yes/No  
* Find and Remove Duplicates 
* Delete unused columns
